# Javascript - DataStructure and Algorithm

I am covering various problem and data structure solutions. I have used `jest` as testing framework that takes care of
unit testing.

## How to run
1. In the root of repository, run following command from terminal `npm install` or `yarn`
2. run `npm run test` or `yarn run test` to run all test cases

## DataStructure

1. Graph - Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix
2. AVL tree
3. Heap
4. Priority Queue
5. Indexed Priority Queue
6. Tree
7. Trie
8. Union Find
9. Linked List
10. Segment tree
11. Array Utils

## Problems

1. Topological sort
2. Find shortest path to each node using Topological sort
3. Find shortest path using Dijkstra
4. Select Item with max weight
5. Balanced bracket
6. Minimum Reward
7. Minimum Coins
8. Count number of ways
9. Lavenstein Distance
10. Linked list palindrome
11. Multi string search
12. Shorten file system path
13. Smallest difference
14. Step multiplication
15. Binary tree diameter
16. Find successor
17. Height balanced binary tree
18. Maximum profit selling stocks
19. Critical node in a graph
